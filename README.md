# Team Grogu - Reboot Challenge 2025 Submission

Welcome to **Team Grogu's** submission for the **Reboot Challenge 2025** in London! 🎉

Our concept is a **personalized, Tinder-like swipable application** designed to help colleagues discover and engage with products tailored to their preferences. The app provides a fun and intuitive way to explore options, save favorites, and make decisions effortlessly.

- View a **stack of personalized product cards** with descriptions and images.
- Enjoy a seamless and engaging user experience.

This app is built with a focus on **personalization** and **ease of use**, making it a perfect tool for colleagues to explore products in an interactive way.
